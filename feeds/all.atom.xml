I've seen it happen with a few musician friends/acquaintances, and read countless blogs and reddit posts about people describing how they got coding jobs without a "real" coding background. This is my entry into that storied tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my first professional coding job (x) weeks ago. I don't have an academic background in programming, and I never attended a bootcamp or took a single programming class. Everything I learned came from online tutorials and Google/Stack Overflow. I actually had to stop myself from writing this article as soon as I got the job because, for every story about someone like me getting such a job, there is another story of that same person feeling out of their depth in their new field. Was I going to end up in the same boat? Would I get exposed as some kind of fraud and get let go within two months?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category></entry></feed>
