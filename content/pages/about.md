## Me

I am a mid-level software developer who made a mid-life decision to pivot from music into tech. I studied piano and composition in college and taught privately for many years to support myself before making that transition. I also used to play piano at a small church in a rural Ohio village but now work exclusively from home. Besides my full-time job doing backend web development for a fintech company I also do part-time backend work for the baseball site [Pitcher List](https://pitcherlist.com/).

### Interests

#### Music

I love the music of [Johannes Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms), [Béla Bartók](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k), [Gabriel Fauré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Faur%C3%A9), [Franz Schubert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert), [Antonín Dvořák](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton%C3%ADn_Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k), [Felix Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn), [Igor Stravinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Stravinsky), and many other "Classical" composers---but especially Brahms. My love of Brahms is probably the first thing anyone who knows me would say about me. I made the YouTube playlist below for people looking to get into Classical music that leans heavily into my favorite composer.

It's often said that Brahms is not easy for beginners, as his music tends to be "cerebral" and introspective; *autumnal* is the word most often used to describe it, especially regarding his late period. I fell in love with it right away, however, and have only grown to love it more and more as the years have passed. One of my life's goals, of which I'm about halfway through, is to learn all of his late piano music, [opp. 116 - 119](https://open.spotify.com/album/0uaisnbddhMuJBXkHXyw7J).

#### Philosophy

I am a proponent of [`critical rationalism`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism) as championed by [Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) and [David Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch). I discovered David Deutsch on [Sam Harris' podcast](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/surviving-the-cosmos) and was immediately won over by his arguments, and I remember thinking how odd it was that even though I had minored in philosophy I never once heard about Popper or his ideas in college.

Deutsch's two books, [*The Beginning of Infinity*](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1G0YG1CLE17W0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8wE_vYDizXfioK5uxCNXfIhza8QjucuNCDtSpzsZB22Ib-qLRmaZqbCyUzmPC9L7REUWkSsQbWsIAi7AAnlgYjz3UzE7v0aNM4BsgUWGXEP7fDQC-6TcKJ5zLwN1WKIO9Y_sfnIAt2_A61Pj3JfH5Ksko9rptC3LXhc0bLrQRK2gMcnoa_zuie_0W_wXtFPxol3V4EP-IFowxTVY3-fUX7nSWfpSCQXdq5mL6ulMpsI.5vUpf75W-AA_wzPD96Ysv-3udX3NlNOq7nXeswtlDh8&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+beginning+of+infinity&qid=1757369135&sprefix=the+beginning+of+%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-1) and [*The Fabric of Reality*](https://www.amazon.com/Fabric-Reality-Parallel-Universes-Implications/dp/014027541X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1G0YG1CLE17W0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8wE_vYDizXfioK5uxCNXfIhza8QjucuNCDtSpzsZB22Ib-qLRmaZqbCyUzmPC9L7REUWkSsQbWsIAi7AAnlgYjz3UzE7v0aNM4BsgUWGXEP7fDQC-6TcKJ5zLwN1WKIO9Y_sfnIAt2_A61Pj3JfH5Ksko9rptC3LXhc0bLrQRK2gMcnoa_zuie_0W_wXtFPxol3V4EP-IFowxTVY3-fUX7nSWfpSCQXdq5mL6ulMpsI.5vUpf75W-AA_wzPD96Ysv-3udX3NlNOq7nXeswtlDh8&dib_tag=se&keywords=the+beginning+of+infinity&qid=1757369135&sprefix=the+beginning+of+%2Caps%2C115&sr=8-2), are favorites of mine; my favorite Popper works are [*Conjectures and Refutations*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415285941/ref=mes-dp?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=jpxjP&content-id=amzn1.sym.476b1b7d-c787-4147-8a3c-fdef209103a1&pf_rd_p=476b1b7d-c787-4147-8a3c-fdef209103a1&pf_rd_r=DPQ3KHJCTDD3WMA7AVMC&pd_rd_wg=F6r9I&pd_rd_r=2e81984a-a68e-437d-a867-e605c97e7e63) and his classic text, [*The Open Society and its Enemies*](https://www.amazon.com/Open-Society-Enemies-Princeton-Classics/dp/0691210845/ref=pd_bxgy_thbs_d_sccl_2/145-4441107-9201718?pd_rd_w=E6g4x&content-id=amzn1.sym.dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&pf_rd_p=dcf559c6-d374-405e-a13e-133e852d81e1&pf_rd_r=5D2Z37KFQNXPQ9BEYQ5E&pd_rd_wg=nJRv4&pd_rd_r=178d1e1c-c252-430c-9a3d-6f79640ed9bc&pd_rd_i=0691210845&psc=1). I've read some of Popper's other works (and there are still a few I have waiting for me [on my shelf](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/96530631-jeff-nicholas?author=Karl_Popper&order=a&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read&view=table)), but those are the ones that left the biggest impression. They're dense works and not always approachable, so I would recommend reading Deutsch first as he follows Popper closely and is a bit more readable for a contemporary audience. [Bryan Magee's book on Popper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117482.Popper) is also very good, although you might have to pick up a used copy.

#### Sports

My job at Pitcher List was borne out of a love of baseball, especially fantasy baseball. Wanting to win the fantasy baseball league that I'd been in for years and had never won was what drove me to learn how to code. Growing up in Michigan I was naturally a fan of the Detroit Tigers, but I love the game more broadly now and will happily flip to any game with an intriguing matchup or a player I really like.

While I haven't written any articles for Pitcher List or any other baseball-centric outlet, I've contributed to some. One I'm particularly proud of is [this piece on a new stat](https://pitcherlist.com/wes-rate-creating-an-improved-csw-rate/) I helped create with author Jordan White called *Weighted Earned Strikes*, or `wES` for short. We "enhanced" the now-standard `CSW` rate statistic by incorporating count (e.g., 3 balls---2 strikes), which Jordan makes a convincing case better reflects a pitcher's ability to get strikes when they matter most. You can view the code that generates `wES` [on my GitHub](https://github.com/jefnic23/wES), where you'll also find some of my other baseball-related code.

### Work

I made a living teaching piano privately for many years before becoming a full-time software developer. I haven't contributed much to open source projects yet, so I likely haven't done or worked on anything that you know of. I built an e-commerce site for my mom, [ceynic.com](https://ceynic-staging-3fadbec13739.herokuapp.com/), that I hope to expand and onboard other artists looking to break free of Etsy. If you're into planes I also made a little game called [*Spot the Plane*](https://www.spottheplane.net/).

[My Résumé]{.callout-title}

Here's my résumé, for anyone interested. I'd like to eventually complete [*The Cloud Resume Challenge*](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) so I can have something prettier to share, but this `PDF` will do for now.

### Contact

Feel free to email me at [jefnic23@gmail.com](mailto:jefnic23@gmail.com).

I'd be happy to discuss Brahms, Popper, baseball, or anything else. If you're interested in collaborating, whether it be with music or tech, I'm open to sensible offers.

## This Site

> Without craftsmanship, inspiration is a mere reed shaken in the wind.
>
> --- Johannes Brahms

I've had a Brahms obsession since early high school; discovering his music was what kick-started my desire to compose and learn piano, and I thought this quote of his would make for a good site title. It captures what I feel to be true of all creative endeavors, which is probably obvious to most people: ideas are a dime a dozen, but execution is everything.

![It also makes for a nice GIF.]({static}/assets/brahms.gif)

### Design

The design of this site was inspired by [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/index) and [turntrout.com](https://turntrout.com/). I originally set out to create a "developer portfolio" website, but those two inspirational sites convinced me to make something more generic and extensible.

I don't have a write-up of how I made this site, but if there's ever any interest I may do so. Both [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/design) and [turntrout.com](https://turntrout.com/design) have design write-ups that'll get you pretty close to what I have, though, and probably in more detail than I could provide.

#### Theme

I experimented with several different themes before settling on [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/). It's simple, easy on the eyes, and as far as I can tell hasn't been widely used by other personal sites.
