My name is Jeff Nicholas and this is my website. I'm a pianist, composer, and software developer. I don't consider myself much of a writer and hope maintaining this site helps guide me down that path, but the real impetus for making this site was mostly as a way to "sharpen" my frontend development skills---even if it's pretty far afield from how modern frontend development is done. What self-respecting software developer doesn't have their own personal website?

What writing I *will* do here is likely to be about software projects I've worked on, insights into music or philosophy or baseball that I haven't seen elsewhere, and any other random thoughts I feel like committing to posterity.
